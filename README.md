# Remote Takeover Framework

This repository will host the source code for the paper:

"Trajectory Prediction-Based Adaptive Takeover Method for Mobile Robot Teleoperation Systems with Communication Delays"

TaskA involves transporting supplies by overtaking an obstacle vehicle.
TaskB focuses on lane keeping on curved roads.

## Requirements
- Python = 3.7
- Carla version: 0.9.11
- To improve simulation performance, it is recommended to launch CARLA with a lower quality setting:
  CarlaUE4.exe -quality-level=Low
Logical G29
